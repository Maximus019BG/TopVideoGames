 <h3> Clutch </h3>
 <article> 

 <p> 
  One of the hardest clutches in Minecraft would be surviving a fall from a high place without any equipment or blocks to cushion the fall. This is particularly challenging because falling from a height of just a few blocks can cause significant damage or even death.</p><p id="row2"> To pull off this clutch, a player would need to time their fall perfectly and use various techniques, such as water buckets, ender pearls, or feather falling enchantments, to mitigate the fall damage.

  <article> 
  
  <p> 
    Ganking is the act of going to an ally’s lane to help secure a kill or relieve the pressure on the ally. Junglers are mostly expected to master ganking compared to other laners.</p><p id="row2"> When other players apart from the jungler go to another lane to secure a kill, it is called Roaming.Remember that while you can roam to or gank other lanes, it can be done to you too. Warding and playing to the information gotten from the wards are good ways to avoid getting caught unawares.

<article> 

<p> 
A Rocket League air dribble is a technique where a player hits the ball into the air and then proceeds to chase it while controlling it by tapping it with their car's wheels or boosting around it, maintaining its height and direction.</p><p id="row2">  The goal is to carry the ball towards the opponent's goal while avoiding their defenders, then make a shot or pass to a teammate for a scoring opportunity. </p><p id="row3">This technique requires precise timing, control, and skill, and is often used by advanced players in high-level gameplay. It can be challenging to master, but it can be a very effective way to create scoring opportunities and keep the ball away from opponents.</p>

<article> 

<p> 
One of the hardest mechanics in the franchise is likely the combat system. Starting from Assassin's Creed II and evolving throughout the series. <p id="row2"> The combat system requires precise timing, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking to successfully defeat enemies.Stealth mechanics are also notoriously challenging, as players must carefully plan and execute stealthy approaches to avoid detection and complete objectives without being seen.<p id="row3">
The combat system also features a variety of weapons, including swords, daggers, and ranged weapons like bows and throwing knives. Each weapon has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, allowing players to tailor their combat style to suit their playstyle.</p>

<section><h3> Dash </h3>
<article> 

<p> 
  In Star Wars: Battlefront, the "Dash" mechanic refers to a character's ability to quickly move a short distance in any direction. This ability can be used to evade enemy fire, close in on enemies, or reach cover quickly.</p><p id="row2">
  Each character has a unique dash ability with different effects. For example, the Rebel Alliance's Soldier class has a "Roll" ability that allows them to quickly roll in any direction, while the Imperial Empire's Officer class has a "Shoulder Charge" ability that allows them to charge forward and knock enemies down.</p><p id="row3">The Dash mechanic adds an extra layer of strategy to the game, as players must decide when and how to use their dash abilities to gain the upper hand in battle. It can also make gameplay more dynamic and fast-paced, as players can quickly move around the battlefield to outmaneuver their opponents.

    <h3> Dolphin diving </h3>
    <article> 
    
    <p> 
      "Dolphin diving" is a movement technique in some video games, including the popular first-person shooter game Call of Duty: Warzone.
</p><p id="row2">
      In Warzone, "dolphin diving" refers to a technique where a player jumps forward and immediately drops prone to the ground in one fluid motion. This movement can be useful for evading enemy fire or quickly getting behind cover. To execute a dolphin dive in Warzone, you can press the jump button followed by the prone button in quick succession.
</p><p id="row3">
      It's worth noting that the effectiveness of dolphin diving as a movement technique can vary depending on the situation and the player's skill level. While it can be useful in some situations, it can also leave a player vulnerable to enemy fire if not used strategically.</p></div></div>

  <h3> No scope </h3>
  <article> 
  
  <p> 
    In the popular first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), a "no scope" refers to shooting a sniper rifle without using the weapon's scope. This can be a high-risk, high-reward technique that can be useful in certain situations, especially at close range where the scope can be a hindrance.
</p><p id="row2">
    When a player uses a sniper rifle without scoping in CS:GO, the weapon's accuracy is greatly reduced, and the bullet is more likely to miss the target. However, some skilled players can use a technique known as "quick-scoping" to quickly aim and shoot without using the scope, increasing their chances of hitting the target.
    </p><p id="row3">
    It's worth noting that "no scoping" is generally considered a less reliable technique than using the weapon's scope in CS:GO, and should only be used in certain situations or by experienced players who are confident in their ability to aim accurately without the scope.</p></div></div>

  <h3> Split dribble</h3>
  <article> 
  
  <p> 
    In NBA 2K23, a split dribble is a dribbling move that allows the ball handler to quickly change direction and split two defenders. To perform a split dribble in NBA 2K23, follow these steps:
</p><p id="row2">
   1. Begin dribbling towards two defenders who are guarding you closely.
    <br>
   2. Press and hold the right trigger (on Xbox) or R2 (on PlayStation) to initiate a quick stop.
    <br>
   3. While holding the right trigger/R2, flick the left stick in the direction you want to split the defenders. This will cause your player to perform a quick step in that direction, splitting the defenders.
    <br>
   4. Once you've split the defenders, you can either drive to the basket or pull up for a shot.
   </p><p id="row3">
   It's worth noting that split dribbles are a high-risk, high-reward move that require good timing and positioning. If you mistime the move or don't execute it properly, you can easily lose the ball or get trapped by the defenders. However, if you can successfully split the defenders, you can create space and open up scoring opportunities for yourself or your teammates.</p></div></div>
